# Multi-threaded Jira Web Scraping Architecture

## Overview

The Jira web scraper now implements a sophisticated multi-threaded architecture with separate components for issue key generation, domain-based rate limiting, and concurrent issue processing. This design significantly improves performance, scalability, and fault tolerance.

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Components

### 1. **IssueKeyQueue** - Thread-Safe Task Queue
- **Purpose**: Central queue for managing issue keys that need to be scraped
- **Thread Safety**: Uses `BlockingQueue` for concurrent access
- **Capacity Management**: Configurable capacity (1000 by default) to prevent memory issues
- **Statistics Tracking**: Real-time monitoring of queued, completed, and pending tasks

```java
// Key Features
- BlockingQueue<IssueKeyTask> for thread-safe operations
- Atomic counters for statistics
- Non-blocking and blocking retrieval methods
- Automatic queue management
```

### 2. **DomainRateLimiter** - Intelligent Rate Management
- **Purpose**: Domain-specific rate limiting to respect server resources
- **Separate Thread**: Runs on its own scheduled executor service
- **Per-Domain Tracking**: Individual rate limits for different domains
- **Automatic Cleanup**: Removes inactive domain trackers after 10 minutes
- **Dynamic Configuration**: Can update rate limits per domain at runtime

```java
// Key Features
- ConcurrentHashMap<String, DomainTracker> for domain tracking
- ScheduledExecutorService for cleanup tasks
- Configurable delays per domain
- Request counting and timing statistics
```

### 3. **IssueKeyProducer** - Issue Discovery Thread
- **Purpose**: Continuously discovers new issue keys from search pages
- **One Per Project**: Each target project gets its own producer thread
- **State-Aware**: Resumes from last processed position
- **Queue Integration**: Adds discovered issue keys to the central queue
- **Rate Limited**: Respects domain rate limits for search requests

```java
// Producer Workflow
1. Load project state (resume point)
2. Fetch search page with pagination
3. Extract issue keys from HTML
4. Add keys to queue (with backpressure handling)
5. Update pagination and continue
```

### 4. **IssueScrapingWorker** - Concurrent Processing
- **Purpose**: Processes individual issues from the queue
- **Multiple Workers**: Configurable number of worker threads (4 by default)
- **Independent Processing**: Each worker operates independently
- **Immediate Persistence**: Saves state and data after each successful scrape
- **Fault Tolerant**: Individual failures don't affect other workers

```java
// Worker Workflow
1. Poll queue for next issue key
2. Wait for rate limiting permission
3. Scrape issue details from HTML
4. Transform to JSONL format
5. Write to output file immediately
6. Update and save state
7. Mark task as completed
```

## üîÑ Threading Model

### Thread Distribution
```
Total Threads = Producer Threads + Worker Threads + System Threads

Default Configuration:
- Producer Threads: 1 per project (3 total for ACE, SPARK, HADOOP)
- Worker Threads: 4 concurrent scrapers
- Rate Limiter: 2 threads (main + cleanup)
- Queue Management: Built-in thread safety
```

### Thread Communication
```
Producer Threads ‚Üí IssueKeyQueue ‚Üí Worker Threads
                      ‚Üì
                 DomainRateLimiter
                      ‚Üì
              StateManager + DataWriter
```

## ‚ö° Performance Benefits

### 1. **Concurrent Processing**
- **Before**: Sequential processing (1 issue at a time)
- **After**: Parallel processing (4 workers + 3 producers simultaneously)
- **Improvement**: ~4-7x throughput increase

### 2. **Intelligent Rate Limiting**
- **Domain-Based**: Different limits for different servers
- **Adaptive**: Can adjust rates based on server responses
- **Efficient**: No unnecessary delays between different domains

### 3. **Queue-Based Decoupling**
- **Producers**: Focus only on discovering issue keys
- **Workers**: Focus only on scraping and processing
- **Scalability**: Easy to add more workers or producers

### 4. **Immediate Persistence**
- **No Batch Loss**: Each issue is saved immediately
- **Resume Capability**: Can restart from exact last position
- **Memory Efficient**: No large in-memory collections

## üìä Configuration Options

### CrawlerConfig.java
```java
// Threading Configuration
public static final int WORKER_THREAD_COUNT = 4;      // Concurrent scrapers
public static final int PRODUCER_THREAD_COUNT = 1;    // Per project
public static final int QUEUE_CAPACITY = 1000;        // Max queued tasks

// Rate Limiting
public static final int CRAWL_DELAY_MS = 2000;        // Default domain delay
```

### Runtime Tuning
```java
// Adjust worker count based on system resources
WORKER_THREAD_COUNT = Runtime.getRuntime().availableProcessors();

// Adjust queue size based on memory
QUEUE_CAPACITY = availableMemoryMB / 10;

// Adjust rate limiting based on server response
rateLimiter.updateRateLimit("issues.apache.org", 1500); // 1.5 second delay
```

## üõ°Ô∏è Fault Tolerance Features

### 1. **Individual Failure Isolation**
- Producer failure doesn't stop workers
- Worker failure doesn't affect other workers
- Queue continues operating during component failures

### 2. **Graceful Degradation**
- Queue full ‚Üí Producers wait and retry
- Network issues ‚Üí Automatic retry with exponential backoff
- Rate limiting ‚Üí Automatic delay and continuation

### 3. **State Consistency**
- Atomic state updates per issue
- No partial state corruption
- Resume from exact interruption point

### 4. **Resource Management**
- Automatic thread cleanup on shutdown
- Memory-bounded queue prevents OOM
- Connection pooling for HTTP requests

## üìà Monitoring and Statistics

### Real-time Monitoring
```java
// Queue Statistics
QueueStats{queued=150, completed=145, pending=5, currentSize=3, running=true}

// Rate Limiter Statistics  
DomainStats{domain='issues.apache.org', delayMs=2000, requests=145, lastRequest=1698234567890}

// Worker Statistics
Worker 1: 45 issues processed
Worker 2: 38 issues processed
Worker 3: 42 issues processed
Worker 4: 40 issues processed
Total: 165 issues processed
```

### Progress Monitoring
- **Queue Status**: Live queue size and throughput
- **Rate Limiting**: Request counts and timing per domain
- **Worker Performance**: Individual worker statistics
- **Completion Detection**: Automatic detection when all work is done

## üöÄ Usage Examples

### Starting the Multi-threaded Crawler
```bash
mvn exec:java
# Automatically starts:
# - 3 producer threads (one per project)
# - 4 worker threads
# - Domain rate limiter
# - Progress monitoring
```

### Monitoring Progress
```bash
# Real-time logs show:
INFO: Starting producer threads for projects: [ACE, SPARK, HADOOP]
INFO: Started producer for project: ACE
INFO: Starting 4 worker threads
INFO: Started worker thread: 1
INFO: Queue Status: QueueStats{queued=50, completed=45, pending=5, currentSize=3, running=true}
INFO: Worker 1 processing issue: ACE-12345
INFO: Worker 1 successfully processed issue ACE-12345 (total: 1)
```

### Graceful Shutdown
```bash
# Ctrl+C triggers:
INFO: Shutting down crawler
INFO: Stopping issue key producer for project: ACE
INFO: Stopping issue scraping worker 1
INFO: Issue key queue stopped
INFO: Domain rate limiter shut down
INFO: Crawler shutdown complete
```

## üîß Advanced Features

### 1. **Dynamic Rate Limiting**
```java
// Adjust rate limits at runtime based on server response
if (response.statusCode() == 429) {
    rateLimiter.updateRateLimit(domain, currentDelay * 2); // Increase delay
}
```

### 2. **Queue Backpressure**
```java
// Producers automatically handle queue full conditions
if (!queue.addIssueKey(projectKey, issueKey)) {
    Thread.sleep(5000); // Wait and retry
}
```

### 3. **Worker Load Balancing**
```java
// Workers automatically distribute load via queue polling
IssueKeyTask task = queue.pollNextIssueKey(); // Non-blocking
if (task != null) {
    processIssue(task);
}
```

### 4. **Automatic Completion Detection**
```java
// System automatically detects when all work is complete
boolean allProducersDone = producers.stream().allMatch(IssueKeyProducer::shouldStop);
if (allProducersDone && queueStats.getCurrentSize() == 0) {
    logger.info("All work completed, shutting down");
}
```

## üéØ Performance Characteristics

### Throughput
- **Sequential**: ~1 issue per 2-3 seconds
